        <p class="normal_text">Global warming is one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time. It refers to the gradual increase in Earth's temperature due to the excessive release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to rising temperatures, unpredictable weather patterns, and severe environmental consequences.
            One of the most effective ways to combat global warming is by protecting and planting trees. Trees play a crucial role in absorbing CO2 from the air through photosynthesis, storing carbon in their trunks, branches, and roots. This process helps reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, slowing down the rate of climate change. Additionally, trees provide oxygen, improve air quality, and support biodiversity by serving as habitats for various species.
            Deforestation, on the other hand, accelerates global warming. When forests are cleared for agriculture, urban expansion, or logging, the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, increasing CO2 levels. This not only contributes to climate change but also disrupts ecosystems, leading to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and reduced water quality.
            Saving trees is essential for a sustainable future. By reducing deforestation, promoting reforestation, and supporting sustainable forestry practices, we can help mitigate global warming and preserve the planet for future generations. Every effort, from protecting rainforests to planting trees in urban areas, plays a role in combating climate change and ensuring a healthier environment for all.</p>
